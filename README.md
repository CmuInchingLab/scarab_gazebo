# scarab_gazebo
Gazebo simulation files for Scarab robot in some random place in the Rocky Mountains. Yay Colorado! 

To run the simulation for the Rocky Mountain environment:
```
roslaunch scarab_gazebo rocky_world.launch
```
TODO:
1) Find out why robot falls through Rocky model heightmap
2) Ask teammates if querying series of Points is suitable for getSucessors()
